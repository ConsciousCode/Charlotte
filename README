Charlotte

Named after Charlotte Perkins Gilman for her story "The Yellow Wallpaper".

charlotte.py takes the following command line arguments:

python charlotte.py delay root

	delay	The delay in seconds to change the wallpaper (real-valued, defaults to 60)
	root	The root folder for getting wallpapers (defaults to .)

Suggested usage:
	Make a batch/bash file which calls charlotte.py with pythonw with your preferred arguments and add it to your startup. If you have some other wallpaper slideshow program/setting, be sure to disable it before running Charlotte.

How to support more OSes:
	At the top, immediately after the import statements, there's an if-elif-else block which checks for OSes. Just implement the change_wallpaper function, and that should cover all portability issues.

How it works:
 * At startup either loads the pickled shuffling status or builds a randomized index list
   - An index list is used to simplify the code for handling the case where the user adds a new wallpaper in between shuffles (if it were just a shuffled list of paths, complicated iteration and insertion/removal code would have to be used)
 * Changes the wallpaper via a set_wallpaper function based on the host OS
 * Periodically traverses the root directory for new wallpapers
